        <h3> Some resources caseworkers are using include:
            <ul class="sources">
                <li><a href="https://www.whitepages.com/">White Pages</a> for a preliminary search</li>
                <li><a href="https://pipl.com/">Pipl</a> for cross referencing, finding emails, verifying given phone numbers, or finding any organizations the loved one may be in.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.infospace.com/">Infospace</a> pulls up internet appearances</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> for information and possible contacts</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.ancestry.com/">Ancestry</a> for connections</li>
                <li><a href="https://homemetry.com/">Hometry</a> gives you the option of contacting a loved ones neighbor if you can't reach them</li>
            </ul>
            Tips:
            <ul class="tips">
                <li>Take little pieces of information from different sites</li>
                <li>Play around with the filters on search sites. Given information may be slightly off due to memory</li>
                <li>It is better to having several possible contacts rather than one contact that you're sure about</li>
                <li>Get creative! Past caseworkers have used prison system databases to find contacts</li>
